Thesis abstract:
The goal of this thesis was to create a graphics engine to demonstrate common BRDF-models used in real-time graphics. 
The design of the graphics engine was realized so that it allows user to easily switch from one BRDF-model to another.
One of the main goals was also to study the mathematics behind BRDF-models and how the models can be implemented in shader programs 
using the High Level Shading Language developed by Microsoft. 
The theory part of this thesis consists of the theory behind BRDF-models that are demonstrated in this thesis. DirectX 11 is 
also described in the theory part of this thesis. 
The result of this thesis was a graphics engine that allows users to examine the BRDF-models that are used in this thesis. 
The code that was written for the graphics engine can also be used in future graphics programming projects.
